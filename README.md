This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized media queries to ensure that the website is responsive and accessible across all devices. I also used flexbox and new css properties for the flipping animation.

## Optimizations:

- Make the images smaller in sized to improve load times and reduce animation frame loss between flips.
- Add more locations to the game and have them sorted between each game. This will create a unique player experience each round with new countries.

## Lessons Learned:

- Learned about new CSS properties
- Working with media queries
- Working with flexbox
